# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # 在main分支发生push事件时触发
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
#   schedule:
#     # * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string
#     - cron: '55 2,17 * * *'

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# 设置环境变量
env:
  TZ: Asia/Shanghai # 时区（设置时区可使页面中的`最近更新时间`使用时区时间）

# 开始工作流
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # 安装和构建
      - name: Install and Build
